This MEG dataset was prepared in the Brain Imaging Data Structure (MEG-BIDS, Niso et al. 2018) format using MNE-BIDS (Appelhoff et al. 2019).

The dataset contains 10 of the 12 participants from the vision-only training group. 

Two participants were removed, one due to problems with the trigger channel, and one due to different settings in the acquisition preventing us from processing the dataset without prior adjustment. 


## EXPERIMENT

Participants were presented with a cloud of moving dots, always starting with incoherent movement (up or down result in equal display, due to the incoherence). 
After 500 ms, the movement became coherent in 50% of the trials (95% coherence, up or down) and remained incoherent in the other 50%, lasting for 1000 ms. Participants were instructed to passively view the stimuli for a total of 120 trials. 

Events: 

1: coherent / down
2: coherent / up
3: incoherent / down
4: incoherent / up


## MEG

Brain magnetic fields were recorded in a MSR using a 306 MEG system (Neuromag Elekta LTD, Helsinki). MEG recordings were sampled at
2 kHz and band-pass filtered between 0.03 and 600 Hz. 

Four head position coils (HPI) measured the head position of participants before each
block; three fiducial markers (nasion and pre-auricular points) were
used for digitization and anatomicalMRI (aMRI) immediately following
MEG acquisition. 

Electrooculograms (EOG, horizontal and vertical eye
movements) and electrocardiogram (ECG) were simultaneously recorded.
Prior to the session, 5 min of empty room recordings was acquired
for the computation of the noise covariance matrix.

Bad MEG channels were marked manually.


## MRI

The T1 weighted aMRI was recorded using a 3-T Siemens Trio MRI
scanner. Parameters of the sequence were: voxel size: 1.0 × 1.0 ×
1.1 mm; acquisition time: 466 s; repetition time TR = 2300 ms; and
echo time TE = 2.98 ms
